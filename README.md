# Covid-19-statistics-applications
A bash program that retrieves statistics for each country(except USA) in the world using REST APIs from the following link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest

- The corona_api_script.sh file its a bash script that downloads the countries names that the REST API supports, 
and then for each country downloads the corona statistics from 2020-01-21 until now (statistics include: Active,Confirmed,Deaths,Date,Recovered).


- The _print_by_date.c file will compile to an executalbe program that prints all countries specific data according to:
i. Date
ii. Key (Confirmed, Death, Recovered, active)

- The _print_graph.c file will compile to an executable program that prints a “graph” according to:
i.	country name
ii.	Key (Confirmed, Death, Recovered, active)

- The _country_data_to_csv.c file will compile to an executable program that creates an csv file and exports all the corona statistics of the given country to this csv file.

- The libEx01utils.c file will compile to a Shared Library (complies to libEx01utils.so file), all the executable programs retrive data structures(an array with all countries, each country cell has all the corona stataistics for the relevant country) from this library.

- Makefile : run 'make all' command in the terminal,
the Makefile will complies each *.c  file to executable  *.out file, and each lib*.c file to lib*.so shared library
